# 3D_DataPoint_Reconstruction

This repository contains Python implementations for camera calibration, essential matrix estimation, and 3D point cloud generation using the 8-point algorithm. The primary focus of this project is to gain an understanding of 3D computer vision techniques.

## File Structure

The repository contains the following files:

1. `return_intrinsic_parameters.py`: Prints a checkerboard image, calibrates the camera, and displays the camera intrinsic parameters.
2. `return_rotation_translation_matrix.py`: Estimates the essential matrix using the 8-point algorithm and recovers the rotation and translation matrices.
3. `recontruct_3d_point.pyy`: Finds the 3D locations of points and displays the 3D point cloud.
